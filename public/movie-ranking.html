<h3>Sound of Freedom</h3>
<p>The movie is a must see. It's all about child trafficking and pedophiles.</p>

<h3>The Greatest Showman</h3>
<p>This movie is how true desires can bring out the best in you no matter what the world says or see. 
<br/>But don't leave your family behind.</p>

<h3>Fast and Furious 1-10</h3>
<p>This movie is all about changing from a bad family to a good one and also family is everything.
